________
SMSKL is situated at Patethan, (Rahu) in between two highways (Namely Pune-Nagar &
Pune-Solapur) & two Rivers (Namely Mula-Mutha & Bhima). Therefore water availability
for irrigation is not constrained. The area of operation of the factory is spread over the
Daund, Haveli & Shirur Tahasil of Pune District. Sufficient Cane availability is strength of
our project. Chairman of the sugar factory Hon. Shri. Pandurang Abaji Raut had taken lead in
establishment of sugar factory in 2003, after the Central Govt. had declared the Relicensing
policy in 1998. The chairman was strongly supported by Mr. Vikas R. Raskar (Executive
Chairman) & with the help of shareholders, colleagues & Cane Growers, the factory came
into existence.

M/s. Shreenath Mhaskoba Sakhar Karkhana Ltd., (SMSKL) is a progressive sugar mill in
Maharashtra, set up in the year 2002-03 and is registered under the Government of
Maharashtra, Registration no. 1622100210937. Shri. Pandurang Raut is Chairman and
Managing Director of the mill. The present installed capacity of the sugar mill is 5000 TCD
along with molasses based distillery unit of 80 KLPD. The management of the mill has
undertaken extensive cane development activities in its area of operations, hence sugarcane
area has increased over a period of time. Considering the increased availability of sugarcane,
the mill has decided to expand its crushing capacity from 2,500 TCD to 5,000 TCD
(operating capacity) and it was done.

The product of this sugar factory is Sugar Unit (Considering crushing capacity of 5000 TCD)
i) White Sugar: ~690 TPD (considering 11.50% on cane)
ii) Bagasse (generation 28.50 % on cane): ~1710 TPD
iii) Molasses (4% on cane): 240 TPD
iv) Press mud (4% on cane): 240 TPD.

M/s Shreenath Mhaskoba Sakhar Karkhana Ltd. commenced operations in 2003-04 with a 3
MW turbine, primarily to meet its own captive demand. In 2012, due to increased selfconsumption, the project proponent installed a 10 MW turbine to serve for the selfconsumption and remains for the export purposes, enabling the plant to export surplus energy
to the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Co. Ltd. (MSEDCL). This brought the total
plant capacity to 13 MW, with 10 MW synchronized and commissioned with the grid for
energy export.

In March 2016, the project proponent executed a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with
MSEDCL to increase the power export capacity of the existing 10 MW turbine, without any
additional capacity. The PPA letter is attached below. Subsequently, the Maharashtra
Pollution Control Board (MPCB) granted consent to operate for 13 MW. However, the
project's capacity remains 10 MW as per the commissioning certificates and the PPA copy.

The project 10 MW Bagasse based Co-generation by M/s Shreenath Mhaskoba sakhar
karkhana Ltd. is a Biomass-based Co-Generation (co-gen) Power Project successfully
commissioned by Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company Limited (MSETCL)
and operational since 21-01-2012. The Project is owned by M/s Shreenath Mhaskoba sakhar
karkhana Ltd. (hereby to be called as Project Proponent, PP).
_____________
PRIOR HISTORY:
The Bagasse-based Co-generation Power Project by SMSKL was initially considered
under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) with two separate prior considerations:
1. 9 February 2012: Named "Bagasse-based Co-generation Power Project by SMSKL."

2. 10 February 2012: Named "10 MW Bagasse-based Co-generation Power Project by
SMSKL."

Despite being identified for CDM, the project was not formally applied or registered under
CDM. The project proponents (PP) now seek to register the project under the Universal Carbon
Registry (UCR) for the issuance of carbon credits. The project’s prior consideration under
CDM but lack of registration or issuance of credits ensures there is no overlap with other
mechanisms.

The Shreenath Mhaskoba Sakhar Karkhana Ltd. (SMSKL) project in Maharashtra,
registered under the bio-fuel/bio-fuel cogeneration category, is identified with project code
002 and has a capacity of 4.545 MW. The project’s commissioning and milestone dates
include 28 August 2012 (initial commissioning), 26 October 2012, and subsequent updates
on 22 November 2016, 26 July 2017, 11 April 2022, and 23 June 2023. The factory is
already registered as eligible for domestic Renewable Energy Certificates (REC) for selfcaptive purposes.

Currently, the project proponents are seeking to secure carbon credits for surplus power
exported to the grid. As per UCR guidelines, the project qualifies for issuing carbon credits
based on the net export energy, ensuring the additionality of emission reductions from
renewable energy generation
